Directed Graph
    When the connections between nodes go both ways. i.e facebook users
Undirected Graph
    When the connection between nodes goes one way. i.e. internet webpage might link might link to a page that doesn't link back
Degree of a node
    Denotes the number of edges connected to a node
    
    In an directed graph, degree is denoted in the following manner
    Indegree
        Number of edges that point to the node
    Outdegree
        Number of eges that point from from the node

Weighted Graph
    When the edges of a graph have a value attached. I.e distance between cities could vary and can be represented on the edges     
Unweighted Graph
    When edges are all the same. They have no Weighted

Cyclic Graph
    Means there is at lease one path back to the origin node
Asyclic Graph
    Means there is no path back to the origin node
Both Cyclic and Asyclic Graphs can be Directed or Undirected

Dense Graph
    Where there is close to the maximum number of connections/edges

Sparse Graph
    Where edges are minimal

Self Loop
Multi Edge Graphs

Simple Graph
    Has no self loops and no multi edges

In a simple directed graph n*(n-1) where n is the number of nodes
